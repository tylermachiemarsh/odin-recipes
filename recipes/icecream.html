        <h3>The Tastiest Ice Cream</h3>
        <p>Ice cream is a classic staple. From children to adults, everyone can enjoy ice cream.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1 Cup Whole Milk</li>
            <li>2/3 Cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 Teaspoon Fine Sea Salt</li>
            <li>6 Large Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>Your Choice of Flavoring</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot 
                cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat 
                and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read 
                thermometer).</li>
            <li>Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or 
                overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.</li>
        </ol>
